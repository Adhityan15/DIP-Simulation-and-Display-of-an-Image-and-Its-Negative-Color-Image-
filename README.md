🧪 Experiment Title

Simulation and Display of a Color Image, RGB Components, and Negative of a Color Image

🎯 Aim

To read a color image, display its Red, Green, and Blue components, and generate the negative of the color image using Digital Image Processing techniques.

🧠 Description

This experiment demonstrates basic color image processing operations.
A color image is represented in the RGB color model, where each pixel consists of three components: Red, Green, and Blue, each ranging from 0 to 255.

In this experiment:

The original RGB image is displayed.

Individual RGB components are visualized in their respective colors.

The negative of the color image is generated by inverting pixel values of each RGB channel.

📚 Theory
🔹 Color Image

A color image is composed of three channels:

Red (R)

Green (G)

Blue (B)

Each channel contributes to the final color of a pixel.

🔹 RGB Components Visualization

To visualize a specific color component:

The selected channel is retained.

The other two channels are set to zero.

This produces a colored visualization of that component.

🔹 Negative of a Color Image

The negative of a color image is obtained by subtracting each pixel value from the maximum intensity value (255):

R' = 255 − R
G' = 255 − G
B' = 255 − B


This operation produces a color-complemented image.

🧮 Algorithm

Read the input color image

Convert the image from BGR to RGB format

Separate Red, Green, and Blue channels

Visualize each RGB component in its respective color

Generate the negative of the color image

Display all results
Output

The following images are displayed:

Original Color Image

✅ Result

Thus, the color image was successfully processed to extract RGB components and generate the negative of the color image using Python.
